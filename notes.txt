Think I have the channels set up properly now.

Now I need to figure out;

    Room creation - Done
        Room management?
    Joining a room
        Invitation system?
        Middleware on the room
        Make sure the routes/channels file properly authorizes users
    Permanence of data
        Redis?
        Or DB?
    Fiddle with routes/channels later
